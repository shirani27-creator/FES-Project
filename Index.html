        <p class="about-me__description">
           <p1> My professional journey spans over 15 years, rooted in operations and administrative excellence. I’ve supported executives, optimized workflows, and driven efficiency across healthcare, workforce development, and government-related sectors. Along the way, I’ve developed a keen eye for detail and a passion for making complex systems run smoothly.</p>

<p2>In recent years, my focus has shifted toward front-end coding, a field where creativity meets technology. I’m currently diving deep into the world of web development, mastering front-end technologies, and building user-centric digital experiences. This transition reflects my commitment to continuous growth and adapting to the evolving tech landscape.
In my current role as an Employment Service Specialist, I continue to leverage my operational expertise while embracing the technical aspects of front-end development. This unique combination allows me to create seamless, efficient systems and engaging digital interfaces.

</p>

<p3>
Throughout my career, I’ve worn many hats—from executive assistant roles, where I managed complex schedules and coordinated multi-departmental projects, to roles in healthcare and assisted living. Each experience has enriched my ability to adapt, innovate, and deliver impactful results.
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Chemistry with a minor in Psychology, and I’m also bilingual in Tamil, which has enriched my ability to connect with diverse audiences. As I continue my journey into front-end development, I’m excited to blend my operational expertise with my growing technical skills, creating solutions that are both efficient and engaging.
